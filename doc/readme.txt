This extension gives some additional control over behavior after user login or logout.  
It gives control over the following behaviors:

 - Whether to display the confirmation page after user login
 - Whether to display the confirmation page after user logout.
 - Whether to direct user to previous page or a set destination.
 - Destination after user login.
 - Destination after user logout. 


To install:

1) Copy the 'twomile_login_redirect' folder into /system/expressionengine/third_party/
3) In the ExpressionEngine control panel, visit the Extensions Manager (CP Home -> Add-Ons -> Extensions).
4) Find 'Twomile Login Redirect' in the list and click 'enable'.
5) Click the 'settings' link and update to suit your needs.


That's it!  Please visit the devot-ee page for this extension, to
provide feedback.  It's a free extension, so support is fairly minimal, but
if you have any problems please post them there and I'll do my best to help.
